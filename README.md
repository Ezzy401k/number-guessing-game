# Number Guessing Game

This Python program is a number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range.

## How it Works
The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player can choose between two difficulty levels: 'easy' with 10 attempts or 'hard' with 5 attempts.

## Features
- Interactive text-based gameplay.
- Random number generation within a specified range.
- Difficulty levels with varying numbers of attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3
